# PartnerUp
Plugin for XivLauncher/Dalamud, shows a warning banner ingame if any of your Sages, Scholars, or Dancers are missing Kardion, Faerie, or Dance Partner.

Why would this be useful you ask?

This plugin can help you help your team help you.

Even been two bosses into a dungeon, and then all of a sudden you realize that you have a dancer, and no one has dance partner?!

Nay, nevermore I say!

Ever gotten to the harder pull of a dungeon and then everyone dies, and then you see in chat "tehe, forgot farie"?

No More! I say!

### Why is this useful?
* Avoiding confrontation and death
* Helping a friend when they forget their partner
* Personal reminder to partner up
